# change md image dir
You can use this code to change image directory contained in md file(e.g. notion doc).

It just changes md file contents. **The actual image file directory is not changed!**

1. Input your md file name.
```
md file name : c:\practice\new.md
```
2. Input image directory you want to change.
```
where is the images? : 23123
```
3. Input new md file's name.
```
new file name is? : asd.md
```

This code may not work well.

But I think It will run well with notion md file at least.
